## Tips & Best Practices

### For Quick Setup

1. **Pre-plan your rooms**
   - Know how many rooms you need
   - Have naming scheme ready (e.g., "Room 101", "Master Bedroom")

2. **Use bulk add buttons**
   - Click "+ Add 3 Rooms" or "+ Add 5 Rooms" 
   - Auto-fills with "Room 1", "Room 2", etc.
   - Rename as needed

3. **Review carefully**
   - Check all room names are correct
   - Verify capacities (1 or 2 people)
   - Use Step 3 review to catch mistakes

4. **Common patterns**
   - **4-bedroom house**: Use "+ Add 5 Rooms" → Remove 1
   - **6-bedroom house**: Use "+ Add 5 Rooms" → Add 1 more
   - **3-bedroom house**: Use "+ Add 3 Rooms"

### For Traditional Method

1. **When adding rooms one-by-one**
   - Use consistent naming (Room 1, Room 2, etc.)
   - Set capacity correctly (can't easily change later)
   - Archive instead of delete if mistakes

2. **Edit house details first**
   - Add complete address
   - Verify name spelling
   - Then add rooms
